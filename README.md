PYTDelivery
===========
Source code of evaluation of "Python for data intensive applications" lecture at MS SIO, CentraleSupÃ©lec

This project is a Flask application that provides an API to populate a PDFs DB from ArXiv.org and make their related informations (URI, metadata and content) available for consumption.

Installing the project on your machine
--------------------------------------
In a terminal, run the following command :

    git clone https://github.com/will-afs/PYTDelivery.git

Your working directory should be the PYTDelivery directory

Make sure to use Python>= 3.7.
You can check your Python version by running :

    python --version

You can use your own virtual environment.
If you are using Visual Studio Code as an IDE, you can find more info on both : 

* https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54106071/how-can-i-set-up-a-virtual-environment-for-python-in-visual-studio-code

If you especially want to use venv, run this command to create a new hidden .venv virtual environment :

    python3 -m venv .venv

Then, make sure to install the necessary Python dependencies in it by running :
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Update the installation of the project with setuptools by running the following command :

    pip install -e .
    
Running unit tests
------------------
The tests are defined in test_xxx.py files, placed in the tests folder.
Once the project is installed with setuptools (see above), the tests can be launched from the root directory by running the following command :

    pytest
    
For more documentation about running tests, please refer to the official documentation : https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/

Running the Back-End locally on your machine
--------------------------------------------
To run the Back-End, you need to run the following commands :

    export FLASK_APP=flaskapp
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask init-db
    flask run
    
Sending HTTP requests to the Back-End
-------------------------------------
Considering the Flask application is running and accessible through the following address :

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    
The application database can be populated by batchs from the ArXiv.org API by running requests as follows :

    curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/documents/populate_db_from_arxiv_api/?cat=cs.ai&start=0&max_results=20"
    
* **"cat" is the category to fetch PDFs into ArXiv.org API**. Here, it is set to cs.ai (Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence).
It is only left for endpoint reutisability purposes : this endpoint does not accept any other category for now
* **"start" is the start index for the ArXiv.org query of their database**. Here, it is set to 0, meaning it will start from the first PDF in base.
To date (December 2021), there are about 41000 to 42000 PDFs stored in their database
* **"max_results" is the maximal number of PDFs to fetch**. The ArXiv.org API user manual discourages to use a max_results value of more than 1000 PDFs, so it is not allowed to provide a higher value

PDFs can also be imported one by one into the application database by providing their URI in the request parameters :

    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/documents/?file_uri=http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9308101v1

*Note : the file_uri argument has to point onto a PDF !*

It will return a Task ID. The Content and Metadata of the PDF will be extracted and stored into the system's database asynchronously.

Getting the general informations on a previously launched task (processing state, file_uri, metadata, pdf_id, link to content):

    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/documents/<task_id>/

Getting the PDF metadata :

    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/documents/<pdf_id>/metadata.json/
    
Getting the PDF content :

    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/documents/<pdf_id>/content.txt/
